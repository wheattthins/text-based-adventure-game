Text Based Adventure Games built with Node.js

> "_It runs on the world's most powerful graphic chip - Imagination_" - Sheldon Cooper

This module is inspired by amazing text based adventure games like [Zork](http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html). 

The game engine is still in active development and supports only basic features. 

_Pull requests and Game Scripts welcome!_

## Installation
Run 
```bash
$ [sudo] npm install -g cli-adventure-games
```

To play, execute
```bash
$ cli-adventure-games
```

## For players
Pick a Game script to start off. 
![player demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arvindr21/cli-adventure-games/master/demos/demo_player.gif)

You will be shown help instructions before you start the game. At any point, you can type `help` to get help.


## For developers
There is a Game Script, that is fed into the Game Engine. The script file is a JSON, that consists of how the game should work. The game engine describes the scenarios listed in the JSON to the player, takes his input and acts accordingly.

You can either contribute to the Game Script, by building one of your own games or you can contribute to the engine as well. 

To create your own game script, please refer to the `Maya.json` in the `Games` folder.

PS : Please check with the me/contributors before updating the engine.

### Todos :  
* [ ] Save & Restore Game
* [ ] Player interaction with the objects (_use swords or rocket launchers_)
* [ ] Implement Lexical processing of commands
* [ ] Build game scripts for Zork I, Zork II and Zork III

Special thanks to Anurag Jain & Jayesh Choudhari for their advice and contributions.
